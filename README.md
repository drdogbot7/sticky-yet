#Are we Sticky Yet??

`Position:Sticky` is pretty well supported… All I want to do is stick one little thing to the top of the viewport… Is it too much to ask to know when something is sticking? This script attempts to add the class 'is-sticky' to sticky positioned elements when they 'stick' and remove it when they are no longer doing that.
